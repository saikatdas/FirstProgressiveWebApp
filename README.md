Progressive Web Apps are experiences that combine the best of the web and the best of apps. They are useful to users from the very first visit in a browser tab, no install required. As the user progressively builds a relationship with the app over time, it becomes more and more powerful. It loads quickly, even on flaky networks, sends relevant push notifications, has an icon on the home screen, and loads as a top-level, full screen experience.

In this codelab,I am going to build a Weather web app using Progressive Web App techniques. Your app will:

Utilize and demonstrate the above principles of Progressive Web Apps.
Use live weather data.
Provide app-like interactions to allow the user to add cities.
